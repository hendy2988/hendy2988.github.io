			<h3>Where to Start</h3>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>When beginning the search for a new occupation, many individuals don't even know where to start looking! Below we have listed several different sources an individual can check when looking for available local employment options!</p>
				<p>Before even beginning to search for job openings, it's a good idea to evaluate your own skills and interests. If you know you'll enjoy the job you're applying for, you are more likely to seem enthusiastic in your resumes and interviews, which will in turn help you seem more fit for the job for which you're applying, making you a more eligible candidate!</p>
				<p>Being familiar with your skill set can also help narrow down job options before you begin your search. For example, if you have a degree in computer science and are a skilled typist with profiency in navigating the internet, you probably shouldn't go apply for a job working construction. Becoming familiar with your capabilities can save both you and any potential employers loads of time when you finally begin the search for your job!</p>
