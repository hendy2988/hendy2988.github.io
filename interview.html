			  <h2>Interview Attire</h2>
				<div class="paracontent">
					<p>Being in the appropriate attire  for the interview gives the impression that you are professional and ready to work. There are many outifts and wardorbes that you can choose from! For men and women the possibilites are endless! For men you need to be looking your best! The same for women!</p>
					<p>Believe it or not, you can tell a lot about a person just from the way he or she is dressed. Even though it would be beneficial for you to arrive early to your interview, you want to allow yourself enough time to pick out a sleek, professional outfit that best compliments your self-confidence and your strictly-business attitude! Be sure to dress according to the job you want and the aspirations you wish to achieve! As Oscar Wilde once said, you can never be overdressed or overeducated.</p>

			  <h2>Interview Tips</h2>
			<h4>Arrive Early</h4>
			 <img src="images/interview.jpg">
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>To start off, be sure to wake up early and get yourself a good breakfast. You want to be alert and ready when you walk into your interview. Be sure to try and arrive early at your interview point, so that you have some leeway in case of bad traffic conditions or other unconsidered elements. Don’t be too worried about arriving early - it’s better to be 15 minutes early than even one minute late! This shows initiative and excitement for the job you are applying for and is sure to help you leave a good first impression with your future boss.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Be Honest</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>Once you have actually entered into the evaluation portion of the interview, be sure that you are accurately portraying yourself. Of course, we don’t mean let your boss in on all the secrets you’ve kept to yourself since the 6th grade. No, we simply mean to have you give your future employer the best, most accurate version of you that is possible. Be confident, and don’t sell yourself short, but don’t over-exaggerate your skills, as you don’t want to bite off more than you can chew in your future job. You want your boss to expect only as much from you as you are capable of, so honesty is key!</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Know What You're Signing Up For</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>	Next, be sure you are both familiar with the position you are applying for as well as incredibly familiar with your own qualifications to earn that position. For example, if you are applying for a job as a cashier in a store, you don’t want to detail your skills as a culinary artist! You would want to describe your strengths in sales and math! Make sure to stay on topic and that the details you are providing about yourself are relevant to what’s being discussed within the interview.</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Know Your Strengths</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>	When detailing your strengths that would be most useful for the job you’re applying for, it can sometimes be beneficial to give examples of ways you have utilized those skills in the past. Provide examples and be ready to show just how good you are with your described skill, simply to help your boss gain confidence in both your ability to use that talent effectively, as well as help him or her gain an increased trust in your levels of integrity!
				Of course, you still want to list your strengths to make yourself look as qualified as possible. As long as what you’re saying is still accurate and is still truthful, the best thing you can do is make sure you’re explaining your skillset in the best way possible. </p>
			</div>
			<h4>Have Good Posture</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>The way you hold yourself says a lot about who you are as a person. It reflects on your self esteem as you enter a room, as well as on your confidence in your abilities to stand out in a crowd and your levels of awareness of your surroundings. If slouch and look bored, this portrays disinterest in your job interview, and might even make you look uncomfortable with yourself and your ability to perform well in your potential employment position. In contrast, if you sit up straight, maintain solid eye contact, and smile often, this shows that you are alert and excited to be sitting in the interview. It allows you to really open up and be more personable and comfortable with your interviewer, which in turn will make you seem more likeable and will help win you points towards earning you your new job!</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Relax!</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>Try not to be nervous before your interview. Although it can be hard to de-stress before entering an evaluation, you must do your best to appear calm and at ease. Any pent-up emotions will be sure to carry over and project through your countenance during an interview and might even hurt your chances of earning your position. Being relaxed allows you to be more personable and relatable, making you seem more immediately likeable and confident. And remember, confidence is essential to portraying your best self!</p>
			</div>
			<h4>Have a Good Attitude</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>When you go into your interview, make sure you are genuinely excited for your potential position and that it shows! Smile brightly and be sure to have a positive outlook when answering your questions! Just a little optimism can go a long way!</p>
