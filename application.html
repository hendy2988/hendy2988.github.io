				<h3>What is a Job Application?</h3>
				<div class="paracontent">
					<p>A job application is a form generally provided by business which addresses specific fields of information they would like to cover prior to your interview. An application is sort of like a pre-outlined resume, asking specific questions about past work experiences, references, educational backgrounds, etc. These act as a sort of insurance policy for businesses so they can be certain that they understand all the information necessary to know before they pass you for an interview. This way, future employers don't risk any possibilities of key information being mistakenly left out of any resumes or cover letters!</p>
