			<h3>CONGRATULATIONS! You have made it this far...</h3>

				<p>After you find the job you want, you’re going to have to actually apply for that position; however, before you can apply, you’re going to want to give your potential employers a little bit of background about who you are and what you’re capable of! The best way to accomplish this is via a resume!</p>

			  <h2>What is a Resume?</h2>
			  <div class="paracontent">
				<p>A resume is a short document detailing your past jobs and achievements. It allows you to effectively list your goals and interests as well as the time you’ve spent honing your skills and giving back to the community. This is your chance to really let yourself shine! You basically get to list all the good things you’ve ever done and expand on all the positive aspects of your character! You get to impress your future boss <em>and</em> give your self-esteem a decently-sized boost! What’s not to love?</p>
			</div>
			<h3>How to Start Your Resume:</h3>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>Resumes are simple to compose due to the fact that all the information you need to include in your resume is already in your own head! You don’t have to do any research for this portion of your quest to get a job. All you have to do is think about what you like best about yourself and begin to list those attributes. In fact, that’s the first step in creating a resume: making a list. Below, we have included our own list of details that would be beneficial for you to include in your resume:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>List qualifications</li>
						<li>List community service projects/hours</li>
						<li>Provide references</li>
						<li>List employment history</li>
						<li>Scholarly Achievements</li>
						<li>List (embellish) strengths</li>
						<li>List personal interests</li>
					</ul>
				<p>Unfortunately, you can’t just throw a list down on a page and submit it as your resume. You have to take some time and properly format the information in order to make it more aesthetically pleasing and organized! The small amount of time it will take you to assemble your resume will impress your employers and make your resume easier to read, as well as reflect positively on your organizational skills.</p>
				<p>Remember, it's always useful to be familiar with a word processing program, and be sure to always use correct grammar and punctuation! Everything you put into this resume is sure to reflect back on you as a person and a potential employee.</p>

			<h4>But you're not done yet...</h4>
			<div class="paracontent">
				<p>No resume is complete without a <strong>cover letter</strong>.</p>
			</div>
			</div>

			<div id="Cover" class="docs" style="display:none">
			  <h2>What is a Cover Letter?</h2>
				<img src="images/kelyn.jpg">
				 <div class="paracontent">
					<p>A cover letter (otherwise known as a <strong>Job Application Letter</strong>) is basically an introduction to your actual resume. It's generally stapled to the front of the resume and it offers a basic overview of the information contained in the resume page.</p>	
					<p>The cover letter allows you to give a brief overview of all your strengths, so your future or potential employers can skim over the information and get a basic idea of your capabilities without being required to read through your detailed resume! In your cover letter, berevity is key. Be sure to save your in-depth descriptions for your resume, where they will be better suited and work more towards your advantage!</p>
					<p>Your cover letter is the ideal place to really set the professional tone for the rest of your resume. Be sure to use proper formatting (Times New Roman font-size 12 is usually preferred) as well as correct grammar and punctuation! Don't forget to be persuasive!</p>
